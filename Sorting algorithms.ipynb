    "- The inner loop will move the largest unsorted number to the right and 'bubble' it out\n",
    "- At the end of the iteration of each outer loop one element has been sorted (largest unsorted number has been sorted)\n",
    "- This allows us to run the inner loop one less time than the previous time because we don't need to compare the largest unsorted number with the largest sorted number.\n",
    "- Take a look above and you will see that the inner loop runs one less time each time\n",
    "- If the inner loop finishes all its iterations and there was no swaps made, that means that there was no number to bubble out. That can only happen if all the numbers are in the right place\n",
    "- In that case we don't need to run the algorithm again\n",
    "- So we stop once one of two things happen\n",
    "  1) **There was no swap made in the full iteration of the inner loop**\n",

    "- On the first iteration we run the inner loop `(n - 1)` times, on the second iteration we run the loop `(n - 2)` times, then `(n - 3)` times untill we get to `1`.\n",
