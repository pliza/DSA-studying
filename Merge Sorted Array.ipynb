    "## Merge Sorted Array Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "- We are given two arrays `nums1` and `nums2`.\n",
    "- `m` is the number of valid elements to sort in `nums1`, and `n` is the number of valid elements to sort in `nums2`.\n",
    "- If `n == 0`, then there is nothing to merge from `nums2`, so we do not need to run any algorithm.\n",
    "- If `m == 0`, then `nums1` contains no valid elements, so we can simply copy all elements of `nums2` into `nums1`.\n",
    "- Otherwise, we need to merge the two arrays in sorted order.\n",
    "- This problem resembles the merge step of merge sort, but we must do it **in place** in `nums1`, so we use **constant extra memory**.\n",
    "- `nums1` already contains “empty spaces” at the end to fit all the elements of `nums2`, which allows us to merge from the back.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pointer Setup\n",
    "- Use two **read pointers** and one **write pointer**:\n",
    "  - `i = m - 1` → last valid element of `nums1`\n",
    "  - `j = n - 1` → last element of `nums2`\n",
    "  - `write = m + n - 1` → last index of `nums1`, where the largest merged element should go\n",
    "- At each step, compare `nums1[i]` and `nums2[j]`.  \n",
    "  Place the **larger** one at index `write`.\n",
    "  - If `nums2[j]` is larger: write it to `nums1[write]` and decrease `j`.\n",
    "  - If `nums1[i]` is larger: write it to `nums1[write]` and decrease `i`.\n",
    "- Continue while both pointers are valid:  \n",
    "  `while i >= 0 and j >= 0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling Remaining Elements\n",
    "- After the main loop ends, one of the arrays might still have leftover elements.\n",
    "- If `j >= 0` (meaning elements remain in `nums2`), copy all remaining `nums2` elements into `nums1`.\n",
    "- If only `i` is left, we do nothing because those values are already in the correct position.\n",
    "- We may also check if `write == i` to avoid redundant operations (copying a value onto itself does nothing).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time Complexity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main While Loop\n",
    "- The first loop runs while `i >= 0 and j >= 0`.\n",
    "- Each iteration decreases either `i` or `j`.\n",
    "- `i` starts at `m - 1` and can be decreased at most `m` times.\n",
    "- `j` starts at `n - 1` and can be decreased at most `n` times.\n",
    "- In the worst case, the decreases alternate until one pointer reaches `-1`, meaning the loop runs at most `m + n` times.\n",
    "\n",
    "So this loop is **O(m + n)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Second Loop (Copying Remaining `nums2` Elements)\n",
    "- This loop runs only if `j >= 0`.\n",
    "- `j` can decrease from `n - 1` to `-1`, which is at most `n` iterations.\n",
    "- So this loop is **O(n)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Total Time Complexity\n",
    "- Total work = main loop (`m + n`) + second loop (`n`)\n",
    "- Ignoring constants:  \n",
    "  **O(m + n)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This matches the optimal time complexity for merging two sorted arrays."
